# Karyasetu Human Resource Management (HRM)

Karyasetu HRM is a comprehensive Final Year Project (FYP) Human Resource Management system designed to streamline day-to-day HR operations in a structured, secure, and scalable way. The platform centralizes employee records and organizational processes into one system so that teams can manage workforce activities consistently, reduce manual paperwork, and generate reliable operational insights.

This documentation focuses on how the backend is organized, how the system behaves through APIs, and how core HR workflows are handled in real-world usage scenarios (admin and employee perspectives). It is written to support development, testing, and future expansion of the platform.

## What you will find here

- Platform purpose, goals, and usage scope
- Backend architecture and development setup
- API behavior, validation rules, constraints, and error handling expectations
- Workflow explanations for common HR actions (end-to-end system behavior)
- Operational logic for time-based records such as attendance (including corrections and auditability)
- Guidelines for extending features without breaking existing flows

## Who this is for

- Developers working on backend services and API integrations
- Testers validating business rules and workflow behavior
- Project reviewers/supervisors who want to understand how the system works at a platform level
- Future maintainers who will add new features after the initial submission

## Platform goals

- Provide a reliable HR platform for organizational record keeping
- Enforce consistent rules (validation, constraints, and permissions) across the system
- Maintain audit-friendly history for critical actions (for example, corrections and updates)
- Support scalability and a clean structure for adding future features
