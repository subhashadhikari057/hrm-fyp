# Designation Module

## Overview

The Designation module provides company-scoped designation management functionality. Designations represent job titles or positions within a company (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Senior Manager", "HR Executive"). All endpoints require Company Admin or HR Manager authentication and are automatically scoped to the authenticated user's company.

### Features

- ✅ Create designations under your company
- ✅ List designations with filters and pagination
- ✅ Get designation by ID
- ✅ Update designation details
- ✅ Delete designation
- ✅ Company-scoped access control
- ✅ Unique name and code per company

---
